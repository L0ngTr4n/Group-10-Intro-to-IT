                    <p class="personalInformation">
                        My name is Chau Minh Tran (SID: s3978736), and I am currently a freshman majoring in Information
                        Technology,
                        minoring in Data Analytics. <br>
                        There are 3 interesting facts about myself that I would love to share. First and foremost, I
                        used to be a student majoring in Business Administration in Suffolk University, USA from
                        2019-2021. After 2 years of foundational business exploration, I had found my career insight
                        about Business Analytics and was about to register for this field. However, due to an
                        unfortunate family incident that took place in 2021 hence I decided to come back to Vietnam to
                        help my family (especially my mother and older brother) and find another way to pursue my dream.
                        In my rejuvenation period during my gap year, I luckily found out that RMIT offered students a
                        chance to attend Data Analytics minor, which I applied immediately because there was no better
                        chance than that.
                        <br>
                        This lore brings out another fact about me: I am 3 years older than most of my classmates. I
                        always joke about enjoying my life even more and the strong sense of coming back to my younger
                        self by observing the younger generation’s spirit, instead of chasing after the fast-going
                        temporary society.
                        Last but not least, I am fluent in more than 5 types of sports so it is really easy to explain
                        how I loved the game of sports at a young age. At a certain time until now, the passion ignited
                        in me to become a sport analyst.<br>

                        Personality traits are suitable for occupation that mostly about aiding other people<br>
                        Suitable: charisma (guiding people with leadership skills), guide (encourage others to learn,
                        grow and be independent)<br>

                    <p>
                        My goal is to work as a VTV analyst in the sports sector. Since traditional sports have been
                        closely synchronised with technology over the past few years, studying and working in this area
                        would undoubtedly help me better understand how technology is being incorporated into
                        traditional forms of human enjoyment, in this case, sports. Additionally, how it will affect how
                        we live in the future and how it might amuse sports lovers for many years to come. Technical
                        expertise, analytical prowess, and soft skills (communication and behavioural characteristics)
                        are prerequisites for pursuing this career. Having a bachelor's degree in data analytics is also
                        a great plus for my resume, and having real-world IT experience will help me realise my dream.

                        My name is Nguyen Hai Nguyen (SID:s3978275), this is my first year at RMIT university.<br>
                        My time in University has been great ever since I started to know more and more people,
                        I even joined a football club and got to play every weekend.
                        As a freshman I have encountered many difficulties while trying to cope with the new way of
                        study.
                        However, with the help of some acquainted seniors I knew since my secondary school period,
                        I believe that I can succeed with all my academic goals.
                        <br>
                        My passion in this industry has been partly contributed by some of my relatives and most
                        importantly my dad.
                        I have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities of technology myself and have always
                        dreamt of being able to make something compelling on my own.
                        I believe that RMIT university with its unique environment from other public universities in
                        Vietnam can help achieve that goal.<br>

                        As of today, I'm still studying for my dream of becoming a game developer. Since the birth of
                        more compact, portable computers, the gaming industry has grown exponentially. With a very large
                        pool of customers, including myself, this industry will surely flourish even further in the
                        future. I believe that the experience and knowledge which I obtain in various IT courses at RMIT
                        will help me achieve my dream.

                        The opportunities had opened up for me to interact with its AI which is Siri.
                        The more I use it, the more useful I find automation in making things simpler.
                        With the development of Artificial Intelligence, people hardly need to do hard labour to

                        general, because of their usefulness as well as their complexity. Since then, I have always
                        dreamed that in the future I will stick to a job related to computers such as being an AI
                        engineer. This choice will probably partially fit my personality as I have a penchant for
                        working alone. Moreover, this industry will probably be very promising in the future because the
                        development of current technology is non-stop. Currently, I have been studying information
                        technology at RMIT with the aim of fulfilling my dream.

                        as a suitable playfield for me to work and improve.<br>
                        Looking further as a Mobile & Web developer, I expect to see opportunities for me in the near
                        future as well as an environment for me to improve my craft to keep up with our fast developing
                        world.

        <p class="description">
            We created an application referred to as EDDIE, or EDucation budDIE. We intend to create an application that
            acts as a student's educational companion rather than focusing on curricular education. Our main goal is to
            assist students in developing their skills in social interaction, and introducing the use of cutting-edge
            technology to advance conventional communication, in this case, artificial intelligence. From that point on,
            the students themselves will accumulate the appropriate approach to their surrounding environment,
            opportunities to socialise and understand the importance of social and emotional development. Therefore,
            students can have a variety of chances to immerse themselves in RMIT society under any conditions. In
            particular, there are four main categories of behavioural traits which we focus on helping students to
            develop, this will be further discussed in the “Aim” section. Chatbot is the main technology (a type of
            Artificial Intelligence) that we implemented in the EDDIE application.

        <p class="description">
            - In particular, there are four main categories of behavioural traits which we focus on helping students to
            develop: decision-making, collaboration (communication clearly, leadership, accept the diversity and opinion
            of others), social awareness (social contribution, social duty, accountability, responsibility for their
            actions), and lastly, self awareness (self-awareness about one's own progression throughout time, enlighten
            themselves with weaknesses that they need to keep an eye on).

        </table>
        <h4 class="subHeader">2. Plans and Progress:</h4>
        <p class="description">
            - The project was started as an educational website for students but as we pursue, it has shown that the
            project might not reach the audience that we want or even keep them stay with the website. So we decided to
            abandon the idea and on the road of finding a new one. We procrastinated this project for a while until we
            find out that if we can make a place where students in RMIT feel like they are belong to, a place people can
            find partners, receive school information and events, a place that RMIT community can rejoin plus also
            solving problems that students nowadays face. And then EDDIE was born.<br>
            - Inspired by Reddit and Quora, EDDIE will also be a forum-like platform and students' discussion will be
            placed in sections, it will have access to the RMIT database and will be the main social media platform for
            RMIT community. Unlike other social media platforms where people can hide their identity. In EDDIE, everyone
            has to log in using their SSID and interact with other students using their real identity, which will create
            a more structured environment and reduce students who “cross over the barrier” which leads to an unhealthy
            community. A platform that focuses for RMIT students, we believe that it will create a great environment for
            students to express themselves and find friends and people with the same interests, the same goal, a place
            for RMIT club to promote themselves and invite people around the campus to reunite as a family.<br>
            - After approving the idea, we know that there will be a lot of things to work on. Starting with the
            platform
            itself. The website needs to be in the RMIT database so any students who are a member of the RMIT will
            default own an account, the website also has to be a part of the RMIT official website so students can find
            it easily.<br>
            - Unfortunately, we do not have the time and resources to develop more beyond an idea but we do implement
            our project as an idea flow from what we want the project to become. First of all, the website needs to be
            simple to understand but also follow the theme that the current RMIT website holds, so the blue bar and red
            RMIT icon are being kept the same.
        </p>
        <img src="images\rmit_website.png" class="image">
        <h1 class="context">RMIT current Website</h1>
        <p class="description">
            - On the blue navigation bar, there will be another selection inside those options that call “forum”. Access
            to the “forum” will lead to our website, users will be welcome and enter their account to use the
            forum.Under the navigation bar, there will be a search bar to find the specific discussion that the user
            wants, to the left are the selection containing these following: “Main page, group chat, event, club and
            setting”. To
            the right, the section will divide into three sections: “Friends, Following and chat bot box”. The middle
            will show the main content of the forum which could be questions, discustion or even questions and answers.
            Depending on the selection of the right box will lead the user to other information on the main page. For
            example, when the user selects the event section, the main information will switch to the upcoming
            assignment on top, under is school event and then club event.<br>
            - When students need specific information, the chatbot on the bottom provides answers using RMIT database
            and
            ChatGPT AI to give the data as close as the user needs and sometimes RMIT related as well.
            The idea does seem simple but it expected to help people more engaging to the RMIT community, it call
            students to engage to discussion, find partner for their project and also easy to access to group with
            similar hobbies within RMIT community.

        </p>
        <h4 class="subHeader">4. Tools and Technology:</h4>
        <p class="description">
            - Chatbot is a widely-used automated program for simulating human conversation and costs from nothing to a
            cheap price as compared to hiring human workers (Investopedia 2021). According to Reve Chat in 2023, 80% of
            businesses will be using chatbots in a variety of ways. Additionally, 2 billion active users all over the
            world are talking to companies through Chatbot (Metric Marketing). The main function which makes Chatbot so
            valuable is the availability of appearing to users ubiquitously without any need of time or physical
            location. In addition to freeing up phone lines, they significantly save costs in the long run than hiring
            staff to provide customer support. Chatbots are getting more innovative at comprehending client needs and
            delivering the assistance they require by implementing AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing). In fact,
            Chatbots are popular with businesses because they enable data collection on consumer enquiries, response
            times, satisfaction, and other factors. Therefore, we utilised Chatbot under 2 functions, named
            Set-Guideline and Machine Learning.<br>
            Set-Guideline: Chatbot provides users a set of specific questions. It has a limited vocabulary and response
            capacity, and its intelligence is limited by the programming that created it. Although it means
            Set-Guideline is limited with every type of conversation, it still performs well with common-asked
            questions. EDDIE aid students in answering questions instantly (whether students use text message in the
            chat box or using voice commands)<br>
            <br>
            For example, students can use “\” command with the category that they want to explore:<br>
            \question : to read and answer to your question<br>
            \student : to give the detail around number of students in the campus and your major<br>
            \schedule : to give you the information about the school event, assignment.<br>
            <br>
            - Machine Learning: chatbot replicates human's neural ability (in this case, answering questions). Machine
            Learning chatbot network usually consists of algorithms that connect to one another and the data it hears
            and sees. The algorithms enable the chatbot to learn and adapt its responses. The bot becomes smarter the
            more exposure it receives to language, text, voice, and discussion. Students will type in their question in
            the chat bar and ML chatbot will provide answers based on data and information that they can harness on the
            Internet database. Common daily usage of Machine Learning chatbot can be Siri and Alexa. EDDIE has the same
            function of actively answering questions based on sources that it can find on the Internet to provide
            students with the most relevant solutions.<br>
            Students will have several options to come up with the solutions on their own because it is inevitable that
            EDDIE may encounter questions outside of its area of expertise. EDDIE will either provide links to websites
            that might have the solutions to such queries or a button that will contact live RMIT agents who can handle
            more complicated situations. In some circumstances, the development team will let users provide immediate
            comments and offer additional questions in order to increase EDDIE's understanding. Following that, this
            feedback is documented for later assessment and application to improve the experience of students with EDDIE
        </p>
        <h4 class="subHeader">5. Testing:</h4>
        <p class="description">
            As for the site testing, we introduce a few of our acquaintances to experience the site, from which they
            will comment on the state of the site. There are a lot of compliments but also a lot of negative reviews.
            But because of those reviews, we can fix the mistakes we are making and improve to a better version. We are
            not experts in website design, but we have tried to find information on the internet on our own so that we
            can fix the errors that the website encounters.
        </p>
        <h4 class="subHeader">6. Risks:</h4>
        <p class="description">
            - ChatGPT is currently unavailable to the Vietnam region, if users still desire to use this type of AI
            (Artificial Intelligence), this will be a problematic challenge to solve. Chatbot can be a reasonable
            alternative for students, however, there are several open questions which can be out of a chatbot's
            capability.<br>
            - There is one major setback for EDDIE when it is only available to students. For instance, if there is any
            complaint and conflict occurs within the platform between students, RMIT offices who are usually in charge
            of student life will face challenges in solving the problem urgently.<br>
            - High cost to install and maintain
        </p>
        <h4 class="subHeader">7. Group Communication:</h4>
        <p class="description">
            - We prioritise effective communication, punctuality and interaction commitment throughout the process. We
            agreed on holding 2 types of virtual platform and weekly face-to-face meetings:<br>
                *On a virtual platform, we set up 2 main channels of communication (Facebook Messenger, Discord).
            Additionally, we utilise Github specifically for task reminder and individual work tracking.<br>
                *We held at least 2 online group meetings per week, Tuesday and Thursday from 8:00 pm as our fixture and an
            additional session during the week of project submission (a meeting would be one day prior to submission on
            Canvas) on Discord. These meetings make sure our group can finish the project in a timely manner as well as
            resolving any technical issues that one or more team members faced during the development process.

        <h1 class="smallHeader">IV, Skills and Jobs:</h1>
        <p class="description">
            - If the project got funded and we got a team of 4-5 people to deliver the project outcome, we would want to
            have two front end developers and two back end developers to make the outcome perfect as possible and one
            for the necessary details that are required for the project to be published. So having a team that has
            experience with web development is very important and a person with a deep understanding in terms and
            conditions. The most important skill that all members of the team require is the communication skill.<br>
            Communication is a key to creating a successful product, we can only help each other if they are open to
            discussion. Not only at members but also users, gathering feedback and improving the bad side is very
            important in every industry where customers are the keys.

        </p>
        <h4 class="subHeader">2. Limitations:</h4>
        <p class="description">
            - Because of the lack of time and experience, our team did not manage to finish the project as we
            wanted.<br>
            - The web for our report although finished but can be polished further as it is still a static web.<br>
        </p>
        <h4 class="subHeader">3. Future Improvement:</h4>
        <p class="description">
            - Our application would have all the basic functionalities of a social-network app that can allow users to
            post and share their story or to start a discussion that would help students in solving their problems.<br>
            - Have direct chat capabilities to AI that not only can reply but also able to give solutions to simple to
            more complex questions.<br>
            - The web for our project can further be improved(smoother transition when pressing shortcuts, more
            animation,
            etc..)<br>
