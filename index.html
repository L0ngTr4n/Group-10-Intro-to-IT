                    <h4 class="subHeader">Personal Information:</h4>
                    <p class="personalInformation">
                        My name is Chau Minh Tran (SID: 3978736), and I am currently a freshman majoring in Information Technology,
                        minoring in Data Analytics.<br>
                        There are 3 interesting facts about myself that I would love to share. First and foremost, I used to be a
                        student majoring in Business Administration in Suffolk University, USA from 2019-2021. After 2 years of
                        foundational business exploration, I had found my career insight about Business Analytics and was about to
                        register for this field. However, due to an unfortunate family incident that took place in 2021 hence I
                        decided to come back to Vietnam to help my family (especially my mother and older brother) and find another
                        way to pursue my dream. In my rejuvenation period during my gap year, I luckily found out that RMIT offered
                        students a chance to attend Data Analytics minor, which I applied immediately because there was no better
                        chance than that.<br>
                        This lore brings out another fact about me: I am 3 years older than most of my classmates. I always joke
                        about enjoying my life even more and the strong sense of coming back to my younger self by observing the
                        younger generation's spirit, instead of chasing after the fast-going temporary society.
                        Last but not least, I am fluent in more than 5 types of sports so it is really easy to explain how I loved
                        the game of sports at a young age. At a certain time until now, the passion ignited in me to become a sport
                        analyst.<br>
                        As I mentioned above, I would love to work as a sports analyst in a sports industry. Due to the fact that
                        conventional sport is strongly synchronising with technology for the past few years, study and work in this
                        field definitely help me to understand about the enhancement of technology applied to human beings'
                        conventional entertainment, how it will shape our future lives and how it may entertain sports fans for
                        generations to come.<br>
                        My experience in IT is considered to be narrow, because I just entered the field for quite a short time. I
                        am padding my knowledge about IT up by reading books and having a serious attitude in class to broaden my
                        knowledge regarding this field.

                        My name is Nguyen Hai Nguyen (SID:s3978275), this is my first year at RMIT university.<br>
                        My time in University has been great ever since I started to know more and more people, I even joined a
                        football club and got to play every weekend. As a freshman I have encountered many difficulties while trying
                        to cope with the new way of study. However, with the help of some seniors I know from my time in secondary
                        school, I believe that I can succeed with all my academic goals.<br>
                        My passion in this industry has been partly contributed by some of my relatives and most importantly my dad.
                        I have always been fascinated by the endless possibilities of technology myself and have always dreamt of
                        being able to make something cool on my own. I believe that RMIT university with its unique environment from
                        other public universities in Vietnam can help achieve that goal.<br>

                        I am pursuing Artificial Intelligence as a minor in Information Technology. 
                        I have been fascinated at how machines work ever since I got my Iphone. 
                        I had a chance to interact with its AI which is Siri. 
                        It was not as complicated as today's version, but it can run the program smoothly automatically. 
                        With the development of Artificial Intelligence, people hardly need to do hard labour to complete the work. 
                        The reason for choosing this particular field was because of my passion for automation, 
                        which will bring simplicity to all works in our life.<br>

                        Web development.<br>
                        The fact about myself is that I have a huge interest in computers. I like to build them, seeing them work
                        and being in the Pc master race community, being able to pull out a better performance out of my machine has
                        always been my interest. At that time, being able to work on my laptop most of the time is my main goal when
                        stepping into university since it is the tool that has a close connection with me so I consider IT as one of
                        the options to pursue. However, it is not a blind pick when it comes to where I am now, I also have a huge
                        inspiration from content creators on youtube around programming, creating unique contraptions and machine
                        learning.<br>
                        Throughout 10 weeks of studying code and micro computer, I see myself more as a “typist”, I enjoy doing code
                        more than learning about computer systems so I chose Mobile & Web development as a suitable playfield for me
                        to work and improve.<br>
                        Looking further as a Mobile & Web developer, I expect to see opportunities for me in the near future as well
                        as an environment for me to improve my craft to keep up with our fast developing world.<br>
