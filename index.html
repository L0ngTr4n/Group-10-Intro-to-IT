            My name is Chau Minh Tran (SID: 3978736), and I am currently a freshman majoring in Information Technology,
            minoring in Data Analytics.<br>
            There are 3 interesting facts about myself that I would love to share. First and foremost, I used to be a
            student majoring in Business Administration in Suffolk University, USA from 2019-2021. After 2 years of
            foundational business exploration, I had found my career insight about Business Analytics and was about to
            register for this field. However, due to an unfortunate family incident that took place in 2021 hence I
            decided to come back to Vietnam to help my family (especially my mother and older brother) and find another
            way to pursue my dream. In my rejuvenation period during my gap year, I luckily found out that RMIT offered
            students a chance to attend Data Analytics minor, which I applied immediately because there was no better
            chance than that.<br>
            This lore brings out another fact about me: I am 3 years older than most of my classmates. I always joke
            about enjoying my life even more and the strong sense of coming back to my younger self by observing the
            younger generation's spirit, instead of chasing after the fast-going temporary society.
            Last but not least, I am fluent in more than 5 types of sports so it is really easy to explain how I loved
            the game of sports at a young age. At a certain time until now, the passion ignited in me to become a sport
            analyst.<br>
            As I mentioned above, I would love to work as a sports analyst in a sports industry. Due to the fact that
            conventional sport is strongly synchronising with technology for the past few years, study and work in this
            field definitely help me to understand about the enhancement of technology applied to human beings'
            conventional entertainment, how it will shape our future lives and how it may entertain sports fans for
            generations to come.<br>
            My experience in IT is considered to be narrow, because I just entered the field for quite a short time. I
            am padding my knowledge about IT up by reading books and having a serious attitude in class to broaden my
            knowledge regarding this field.
